This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I created an authentication system with Firebase and an API call to retrieve information in a Remote Database (GitHub).

The user(s) can initially log in with a personal account created on site, and once inside the app they also have the chance to update their credentials.

The search bar offers the possibility to search for some github user and grab some informations regarding their names and locations, plus some others info like companies they work for or webpage addresses, when available.

Whenever the user(s) don't have any account, they can decide to create one or access the service with a Guest account provided.

For the design I used Bootstrap and React Bootstrap, the form are handled with Rect Hook Form, the back end part is managed with Firebase, an example chart is provided using ChartJS.
